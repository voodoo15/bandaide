# Band Aide

This is our Bitmaker final assignment.  The purpose of this app is to facilitate a way for local musicians and bands to find each other.  Users can create a profile and put their bio/description, youtube url and skills (lead, bass, singer, etc) to help promote themselves.

Users can create bands and create positions by skill for their bands.  When users look for bands that have position vacancies, they can apply to the position which will display to the band creator/leader.  The leader can accept or reject the user/applicant.  

Users can either search for bands by genres on the landing page or via the search page if the users signs up to the site.  Also, band leaders can search via the landing page by skill or on the search page as well.

Some features that we would like to add to the site are:

1. Communication feature (currently there is a link for e-mail for contact)
2. Video feature to record a promo for the band
3. Social media and soundhound or other sites to promote material for the user/musicians
4. Ways to promote the band after the band has been formed
